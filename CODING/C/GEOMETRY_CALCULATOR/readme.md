## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

This utility is still in development and planned future improvements include:

- Additional shapes (e.g., pyramid, cone)
- Unit conversion (e.g., feet â†” meters)
- Colored terminal output for results and warnings
- Ability to save calculation history to a file
- Optional floating-point precision toggle
