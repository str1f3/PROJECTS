# GEOMETRY CALCULATOR

## OVERVIEW

This geometric calculator can be used for quick calculations involving 2D and 3D geometric shapes. Users can compute **area**, **perimeter/circumference**, **surface area**, and **volume** using standard geometric formulas and user-provided inputs.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

This utility is still in development and planned future improvements include:

- Additional shapes (e.g., pyramid, cone)
- Unit conversion (e.g., feet â†” meters)
- Colored terminal output for results and warnings
- Ability to save calculation history to a file
- Optional floating-point precision toggle
