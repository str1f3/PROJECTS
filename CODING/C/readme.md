# OVERVIEW

This repository contains a collection of C-based programs that explore various aspects of systems programming, file handling, and cybersecurity fundamentals. Each directory represents a standalone project demonstrating specific programming techniques and problem-solving approaches. The AUTHLOG_PARSER analyzes authentication logs to extract and evaluate login attempts, showcasing string parsing and file handling. The BITWISE_CALCULATOR performs arithmetic and logical operations using bitwise manipulation. CLI_WRITER demonstrates formatted output and file writing through command-line interaction, while FILE_COPIER replicates low-level file copy operations using standard I/O functions. The GEOMETRY_CALCULATOR computes geometric properties such as area, perimeter, and volume through modular C design. The KEYLOGGER serves as an educational example to study keystroke capture techniques and their ethical implications. The PASSWORD_GENERATOR creates randomized, secure passwords using customizable character sets, and the PINCODE_GUESSING_GAME provides a simple yet illustrative example of loops, conditionals, and random number generation. Finally, the SNIPPETS directory contains reusable code fragments and examples intended for experimentation and quick reference.
