# OVERVIEW

This directory contains a collection of programs originally developed in C and later re-implemented in C++. The project demonstrates my proficiency in both procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through the systematic migration of C-style code to modern C++. The conversion process involved refactoring C data structures and functions into classes, integrating the Standard Template Library (STL) for container management, replacing manual memory handling with new and delete, and transitioning from C-style I/O to iostream-based streams (cout/cin). This work not only preserves the functionality of the original C implementations but also highlights my ability to modernize legacy codebases while adhering to contemporary C++ programming practices and standards.
